by O
Age O
UK O
as O
part O
of O
its O
Care O
in O
Crisis O
campaign O
, O
demanding O
urgent O
reform O
of O
the O

system O
for O
older O
and O
disabled O
people O
. O

Nurses O
in O
the O
survey O
backed O
the O
campaign O
’s O
aims O
, O
with O
virtually O
all O
respondents O
saying O
reform O
was O
needed O
to O
either O
the O
social O
care O
funding O
system O
or O
the O
legal O
and O
assessment O
frameworks O
used O
for O

Age O
UK O
Charity O
Director O
Michelle O
Mitchell O
said O
: O
“ O
These O
findings O
provide O
an O
interesting O
snapshot O
into O
how O
the O
crisis O
in O
social O
care O
is O
experienced O
by O
those O
working O
at O
the O
frontline O
of O
care O
: O
nurses O
in O
both O
hospitals O
and O
in O
the O
community O
. O

“ O
These O
nurses O
report O
seeing O
social O
care O
services O
for O
older O
people O
reduced O
and O
as O
a O
result O
older O
people O
having O
to O
routinely O
stay O
in O
hospital O
longer O
than O
medically O
necessary O
because O
the O
support O
is O
not O
there O
for O
them O
to O
go O
home O
. O

This O
not O
only O
is O
distressing O
for O
older O
people O
but O
also O
makes O
no O
sense O
financially O
as O
the O
cost O
of O
a O
hospital O
bed O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
much O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
providing O
social O
care O
support O
. O
” O
She O
added O
: O
“ O
We O
urge O
the O
government O
to O
show O
vision O
by O
creating O
a O
system O
of O
social O
care O
that O
is O
fair O
and O
sustainable O
– O
the O
social O
care O
system O
is O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
collapse O
and O
needs O
urgent O
reform O
. O
” O
Queen O
’s O
Nursing O
Institute O
director O
Rosemary O
Cook O
said O
the O
causes O
of O
delayed O
discharge O
had O
to O
be O
“ O
tackled O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
urgency O
” O
. O

She O
said O
: O
“ O
We O
know O
that O
people O
would O
rather O
be O
in O
their O
own O
homes O
, O
and O
are O
usually O
healthier O
and O
happier O
there O
. O

We O
also O
need O
to O
reduce O
the O
strain O
on O
our O
hospitals O
, O
so O
that O
as O
much O
time O
and O
care O
as O
possible O
is O
freed O
up O
for O
those O
patients O
who O
do O
need O
to O
be O
there O
. O
” O
“ O
The O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
readiness O
of O
the O
community O
to O
receive O
people O
back O
for O
care O
has O
been O
going O
down O
, O
while O
the O
demand O
has O
been O
going O
up O
, O
” O
she O
added O
. O

“ O
Unless O
we O
reverse O
the O
trend O
towards O
dilute O
skill O
mix O
and O
over O
stretched O
community O
nursing O
teams O
, O
we O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
accelerate O
discharge O
, O
never O
mind O
facilitate O
the O
shift O
of O
care O
out O
of O
hospitals O
altogether O
. O
” O
However O
, O
Ms O
Cook O
noted O
there O
were O
some O
good O
initiatives O
around O
the O
country O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
Stockport O
assistant O
practitioners O
were O
working O
across O
health O
and O
social O
care O
, O
and O
in O
other O
places O
she O
said O
community O
nursing O
teams O
were O
now O
co O
located O
with O
social O
care O
teams O
to O
provide O
a O
more O
“ O
seamless O
and O
patient O
ready O
” O
service O
for O
discharged O
patients O
. O

The O
government O
is O
due O
to O
publish O
a O
white O
paper O
on O
the O
future O
of O
